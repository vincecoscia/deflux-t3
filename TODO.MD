# Bugs & Features
-- Refetch trades after import/ add refresh button to page to get new trades
-- Finish TradingView Import. Work on how we may need to refeactor some of the processes 
(Maybe remove balance and instead add overall P&L OR for those that don't include balance, just make balance = overall P&L)
-- Create a new planetscale DB to separate QA, STG, & PROD branches
-- Should have local DB set up so that changes can be made locally


# User Story
-- A user should be able to look at every trade within a group, add commentary, tags, and images (80% Complete)
